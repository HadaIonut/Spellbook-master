Spellbook Master is a quick and simple Foundry VTT module that exports an actor's spells as a spellbook with the press of a button.

Who needs it? Well to be honest mostly me... But it is usefull for any DM that likes having a lot of spellcasters in their encounters and wants to have a really easy way to make a spellbook for the party.

Could this be a macro? Most likely but I don't know macros.

## Installation 

For now you can install this module only by copying the manifest url into the module install.

Manifest: ```https://github.com/HadaIonut/spellbook-master/releases/download/v0.0.1/module.json ```

## Usage

Just click the `Spellbook exporter` button in the header of the actor's sheet and you will find a new spellbook in the items tab.
Note: To make sure all spells are found all compendiums that contain spells must have the `spells` keyword in the name.
